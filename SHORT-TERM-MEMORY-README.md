# Memory System Enhancement

## Overview

This update enhances the memory capabilities of the chat application by implementing a dual-memory architecture:

1. **Long-term memory**: Vector database (existing system)
2. **Short-term memory**: In-memory cache (new addition)

This solves the edge case where the AI doesn't immediately remember information that was just mentioned, especially users' names.

## Key Files Changed

- `/src/lib/shortTermMemory.ts` (NEW) - Short-term memory implementation
- `/src/components/ShrinkChat.tsx` - Integration of short-term memory into chat flow
- `/docs/short-term-memory-fix.md` - Detailed documentation
- `/test-short-term-memory-standalone.mjs` - Test script

## How It Works

1. When a user introduces themselves, their name is captured and stored in both:

   - The vector database (for long-term retrieval)
   - The short-term memory cache (for immediate access)

2. If the user immediately asks if the AI remembers their name:

   - The system detects this is a name-related query
   - It checks short-term memory first
   - Responds immediately with the name
   - Bypasses the slower vector search process

3. For other types of questions:
   - The system continues to use vector search to find relevant past conversations
   - Generates a response using both memory systems

## Testing

Run the standalone test script to verify the short-term memory functionality:

```bash
node test-short-term-memory-standalone.mjs
```

All tests should pass, confirming proper functioning of:

- Name extraction
- Pattern recognition
- Immediate recall
- Conversation storage

## Next Steps

The short-term memory system can be extended to handle other types of immediate recall beyond just names, such as:

- Recent topics discussed
- User preferences
- Emotional states
- Follow-up questions

## Further Reading

For more detailed information:

- See `/docs/short-term-memory-fix.md` for implementation details
- See `/docs/memory-fix.md` for the vector database fix

This enhancement significantly improves the conversational flow by ensuring the AI doesn't "forget" information that was just shared.
