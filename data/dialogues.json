How on earth do you manage with two broken arms? I don't. She's cool. You could learn a lot from your wife about how to talk to people. Are there people who say things about you, Sophie? That some of the girls at the gym might be jealous of you and how close your relationship is with Cy? Don't talk to me like I'm a child. How do you get along with Cy's wife? I don't wanna talk about them. \"During first session, appears to be very impressive. \"Sensitive, mature for her age, \"very intelligent and a highly independent personality. \" - Do you really think those things you wrote? - Absolutely. It isn't serious, it comes off in a week. My cousin stayed over last night. She's here visiting colleges, so She had to sleep in my room and I had to sleep on the couch. When I woke up this morning I couldn't move my neck. I had to go to the doctor today, anyway, to get my casts off. He took one look at me and was, like, \"I don't think so\". He put this thing on me. He left my casts on too because I don't know why, actually. I guess taking them off might cause too much strain on my neck. I found something for you, thought you should have it. In here? - Yeah, in the front pocket. It's for your collection. It's a catboat. It's beautiful. Thank you. It's a going-away present. This is our last session, right? You said three. No, I said at least three. If you're totally sick of listening to other people's insipid lives then maybe you can look at it and it'll make you feel like you're somewhere else. Insipid. It's a good word. I read thesauruses for fun. I'm not a freak, OK? I just like words. Thought you could use it. It must really suck having to listen to other people's problems all day. Mm. So does that chair, like, enhance your brain function? - I don't think so."

I was dancing around on a log in the back yard, to entertain Dana. You know, doing spins and things. He put me on a beam the next day. Their house was like my house. I had a key. Before my father left, when he and my mom were fighting all the time, I slept over. I had these really bad attacks back then.

So I knew, even before Darlene went away, I knew that he loved me. And then she left for six months but Cy wouldn't have sex with me. Even though everyone assumed we were doing it, that we'd been doing it for months. Cy said it was a line that we absolutely, positively would not cross. We'd been sleeping in the same bed. Just sleeping. And then, one night, the night before Darlene came home, I woke up in the middle of the night and he was awake. Then he I It happened. It felt like nothing at all. Like nothing? Not good? Not bad? Kind of like Kind of like I was watching it happen. On a really small black and white television. Like, I was checking my email at the same time. Like I wasn't really there. I don't know. The next day we pretended like it hadn't happened. And at practice that afternoon we had this big fight, in front of everyone. Cos of what happened? Because I fell off the beam. I'd been going for this backbend, and for some reason I thought that the beam was longer than it really was. So, I bent right off of it. I fell flat on my back. I just stayed there trying to breathe, afraid to move, afraid that I'd broken something. And then Cy came over and started screaming at me, \"We've got two days until this tournament and you've lost your focus, \"now get back up there and do it right. \" That night I slept on the couch. Then in the middle of the night, Cy came in and I thought that But he wanted me to put Dana back to bed. She'd had a bad dream and came into his room looking for me. So I put her back to bed and then we talked. He kept talking about my potential. He said it would ruin both our careers if this got out. He said that we had to stop. That's it. We almost had sex again that night, but he didn't want to. That's it. A few weeks later Darlene said she wanted to talk to me. She said that Dana had become too attached to me while she was in Wisconsin and that I probably shouldn't come over for a while. But it was pathetic, because I know her, you know. She was lying to me. I couldn't look at her. I just said, \"I'm sorry. \" She said \"Don't be silly, \"kids forget quickly. \"Grown-ups don't, but kids do. \"Dana will forget you. \" Dana will never forget you, Sophie."

That it was so trivial? Yeah. That's what I felt. Absolutely. And here's how it happened. Michaela was making salmon - it's always salmon on Tuesdays - and I told her I wanted to leave home.

She just said that, um \"I could have guessed this would happen. \" And, \"You never surprise me, Alex, not even now. \" How did you feel about that? Were you Were you hurt by that?

When she was 22, she was already working on her PhD at Georgetown, so if she says she was expecting it, then I got to believe she saw me going through something since the bombing and the heart attack and the suspension from the force. She saw much more than I was willing to show. And realised that it could result in us separating. Hmm. You know, what's interesting is that you're talking today about your wife like she was some mythical superwoman that's able to anticipate everything ten steps in advance. As far as intelligence goes, absolutely. No matter what else you say about her, she's got the brains of a rocket scientist on the Manhattan Project. Still, wasn't there something in her reaction that disappointed you? I mean, you come home, you drop this bombshell and she's indifferent to you. That isn't the case here. We're not one of those couples that creates drama all the time. We could have dragged this on for years, just for the sake of the kids, as they say."

You know uh, Roy's 11 years old and he hardly ever leaves the house. He just sits at home and he sits by the computer and he plays chess and He just No girlfriends. No buddies, no basketball. At first it drove me crazy because he just seemed so miserable. So lonely. Unpopular. I tried everything - I organised tours at the air force museum, for all the kids, they could come and sit in the cockpit of a real F-16 and play with the simulators and It was no use, I mean, in those tours he walked round all alone. Yeah. No one went near him, he was like some I don't know, some ugly leper kid that all the kids were afraid to get next to. Kind of hard to see that, isn't it? Yeah. Sometimes it's harder for us as parents to see our kid lonely than it is for the kid himself. It took me a long time to realise that. Until I realised that he was happy. That I had the problem, that I couldn't accept the fact that he wasn't popular. That he's an outsider and that's OK, it's just his personality. I used to give him and Michaela such a hard time. I'd call the counsellor, the teachers, and everybody said, \"There's no problem, the boy feels good about himself. \" It's just the way it is. Was that hard for you to accept? Yeah, but, you know, today I'm jealous of him. Because he doesn't need anybody, he's got his own world. He's got his movies and books and computer games and chess, and the kid was born without a competitive bone in his body. Even the chess stuff, he doesn't care if he wins. He just likes the thinking it requires. A few years ago I organised this Ping-Pong tournament for his class in the back yard. He says to me, \"Don't you feel sorry for these kids? \"Only one will win, it's probably Robert. \"And the rest will look pathetic in front of the girls. \"Don't you feel sorry for them?\" I swear, I don't know where he got those genes. Certainly not from me. You think he's too good to be connected to your genes? Are you making fun of me? I just want you to listen to what you're saying about yourself. This boy is your own flesh and blood. You love him, dearly. You're very proud of his beautiful qualities. And yet, you think, \"Well, he's the exact opposite of me. \"He couldn't possibly be connected to me. \" Please, let's not get into that again. No This is completely a genetic issue. He got the female genes from Michaela and my mother. My mother was the same way, there was selflessness in everything she did, just like Michaela. She never felt like she was missing out on something. She didn't care if she was fulfilling herself and all that shit. There was just There was something pure about her. Wholesome. Like Roy. No, he got that from her. So, the women in your family are they're pure and wholesome, unblemished. And the men are somehow the opposite - dirty, in conflict with themselves? That's not a bad description of my father. Dirty as hell. He kept falling in love with different women at the office. He was having affairs like some kind of dirty dog, yes. The guy had it made, he had a woman at home who loved him, let him have his career, no questions asked. She took care of the kids and made sure that the entity called family existed. What you got to understand about my dad, he lived this whole life on this civil rights pioneer ticket. The guy who survived the Klan and marched with King. Who could say anything to him? He suffered for us all. Mm. And your mother wasn't part of that movement? Not like him, not like my dad. She was from back east, from Delaware. Well-bred, she was the hope of the family. A pianist. She studied at the music academy. She was considered a virtuoso, she could play Liszt in her sleep."

Right before King's big speech, Mahalia Jackson sang that song, I've Been 'Buked And I've Been Scorned. And they caught eyes in the crowd and they both had tears flowing down their faces and they felt connected. My father was this lonely, angry man and she well, she melted him.

And you, unlike him, you're trying to do the right thing? You're leaving home just like that? You're not dragging out things like he did. OK, all right, all right. I see you believe in the whole theory that children try to rectify what their parents did wrong. OK, OK. I don't know that it's about rectification. I think it's more what we call a pattern. We unconsciously repeat patterns that we have witnessed in childhood. You said I was trying to rectify what my father did. I think you're presenting it that way but on a deeper level I think there may be more similarity between you and your father's view of marriage. I don't know what you mean. Really? You can't see any way in which you and your father may have married the same kind of woman? It seems to me that you both married women whom you admire but that you don't necessarily love. That's some bullshit You actually buy this shit? That I'm repeating my father's mistakes? Let me tell you something. What's going on in my marriage has got nothing to do with my father, so stop comparing us. Perhaps you might not have loved Michaela because you admired her so much for being so so perfect. Why are we still talking about Michaela? That story is over. Because I'm not sure that your leaving her is really the solution to how you feel about yourself. I want to go back to Laura for a minute. Why is it so important to go back to Laura? Is it because she's my patient and you think it might bother me that you met? Whoa, whoa, I don't get this. Why can't I talk about her? What is the big deal about meeting her? Hey, Paul you won't believe how much this cost. $450. I mean That's crazy, right? Too bad they don't sell property on the online auctions. Now that Michaela has the house, during the Indy 500 I could go on, get a place in the same neighbourhood for almost half a million bucks. You got the deal of your life here, Doc. Somebody who doesn't know about the whole TV factor would have paid 1500, so if I'm here for a year, that means you're renting it for eight bucks a week. Can we get back to our therapy session, Alex? Oh. OK, well, Laura couldn't get over it. I showed her the machine and she just she couldn't believe it. Would you like to, er Would you like to tell me how you two met? Sure, I lost track of time. I moved in with my gay friend, Daniel, and his little boyfriend. I told you about them, yeah? And they are real happy I left home. They bring their friends over to meet me and I'm the talk of the gay community. So, I'm going along with it - dinners, drinks. I even went to this gay club with them on Sunday. They told me there'd be some hot ladies, some that I could pick up, that aren't even lesbians, so Didn't do anything for me. What it did was make me lose track of time, I was up all night. So, I could've sworn yesterday was Tuesday. So, I came here, but when I got here I saw Laura leaving. I walked up to her and I asked if everything was OK. She said everything wasn't OK, that she ran over a dog - or almost ran over this dog, yesterday morning. The way she described it, it sounded like this the Airedale terrier pedigree - the Airedale terrier is the only dog in history to be knighted by the King of England for bravery in battle. Did you know that? I didn't know that, no. Yeah, well, it did. It's an amazing story. This dog OK, well, maybe next time. So, I asked her, if she had been leaving a session with you. She was a bit taken aback, like I had caught her in something shameful. Hell, I thought only navy pilots felt that way about seeing a shrink. Mmm. Ah. Yeah. I admitted to her that I was seeing you also and I realised that I was here a day early. She thought that was just hilarious, that someone could get the days mixed up. And she's got this She's got this way of looking at you. You know, it's like there's something fierce about this girl."

This is not going to happen. \" In your mind, is there any possibility that the affair could become a reality? No, in your mind. Look, I have to admit, sometimes it's it's flattering. I I I can't help but enjoy the the feeling. But I told her no. I said, \"This cannot happen. \"You cannot go through that door, there are limits. \" Is that what upset you, that she was testing you? Gina, it's not that abstract. She's she's a beautiful woman. She says she wants to have sex with me, I I know what's in her head, so I don't want her going through the door and maybe bumping into Kate. But you said you did want that. Some part of you wanted that. No, I No. The point I'm making is that I want Laura to understand that we can survive this, that any attraction that comes up between us, I can handle. I am not going to let this derail the therapy."

We were watching TV and I said, \"I don't think this pregnancy's worth fighting over. \" And I said, \"I think I might want this baby. \" Then I said, \"Think about it some more, \"because I pity a child born to a mother who doesn't want him. \" And I said, \"I just said I think might want this baby. \" And that was it. And we laughed. And I woke up the next morning, it was late, actually, he'd left for work already and taken Lenny to school, and I just decided to take the day off. I was just lying in bed thinking, enjoying myself, enjoying my thoughts, and I thought about giving birth and for the first time I wondered whether it was a boy or a girl and I just somehow knew that it's a girl. And I could imagine Lenny pushing some kid who tried to take her bike, it was sweet. Violence turns her on. And then I got dressed, and the waistband in my pants was a little tight, which I didn't love, but I didn't get upset about it. So you haven't seen Dr Kornreich since? Mm-mm. And I assume you've discussed this? Well, not really. Jake asked what happened at the doctor's, and I said, \"I didn't go,\" and we didn't talk about it any more. I mean, we have time, you know? - So, what do you think? - Well First of all, I'm really glad that you came back. You both seem much more relaxed than than last week. And, er since a week has gone by, you actually have less time to decide, but that doesn't it doesn't seem to be bothering either of you. Less time? What, are you pressuring me now? I mean, we have at least two weeks. I don't know, I I think we've said everything that we need to say. I think what Amy's trying to say, Paul, is that this is gonna be our last session.

I felt like you wanted to make sure that this was a safe place, that the same things that happen out there don't happen in here. Right when the accident happened I don't remember anything but, right afterwards, I remember the whole world was silent. Not just silent. Soundless. You know, like there had never been any noise, ever. Not even that hum that you hear when you're in an empty room. Nothing. Even inside the ambulance, people were talking and it was like, it was like I'd gone deaf. I felt relieved. I thought that I would never have to listen to anybody ever again. Sound came back, though. At first, from far away. The EMT, she kept saying, \"I have to hear your voice. I have to hear your voice, sweetheart. \" She wanted my parents' phone numbers. She wanted them to come and meet me when I got to the hospital. There was no way. They can't even sit in the same section at my meets. I have to wave to two different spots after my routine. I look schizo. I tried to sit up and told the EMT that I wanted to see the outside. Why? When you see an ambulance tearing down the street, you turn and look. Well, I wanted to see what it was like, being on the inside, looking out. You know, seeing people's faces on the sidewalk, wondering, \"Who's in there? Is she going to be OK?\" I couldn't sit up. The EMT, she had this mirror that she tried to angle, so that I could see out but all I could see was myself. And I remember thinking, \"Both arms, Sophie? \"Did it have to be both arms, you idiot?\" Our time's up. OK. We'II, um We'll take it up there when you come back next week. You're not going to training camp with everyone else in the universe? I'll go get your clothes, call Kate. He didn't offer you a cup of tea, even? Are you sure that doesn't hurt? All right, you.

Would you stop drawing conclusions, Gina? I'm just telling you about my week. Let's see, er, in other news, er Kate took her affair to Rome this week. When Sophie collapsed in my office I, er I yelled out for Kate, then realised I was alone in the house, I was the only one there. Did you and Kate discuss anything?

I think one of the reasons I married Kate was to get back at my mother because it was some kind of strike against that whole notion of I don't know, victimhood. One thing you can say about Kate is she never played the victim. She makes up her mind to go to Rome, she goes to Rome. It's been 18 years since I've been alone in that house.

So personally, I had to wonder if it wasn't an echo of an earlier rejection. Oh, please, Gina. Not this again. I know exactly where you're going with this. A son who feels he's disappointed his father, a son who feels he hasn't lived up to his father's expectations. It's something you'd want to address. Please don't minimise what you said to me, Gina. I wasn't reacting to something in my past in relation to my father. One review drove you out of the institute. That letter pissed on eight years of my work. Despite it, though, I became an excellent therapist. And some people might say that, er I became a better therapist than you. Maybe you feel that. Maybe that's what this is really about, Gina. So, let me ask you again, why did you come to me specifically? I suppose because I needed to I don't know, test myself. I already knew, before I came here, what you were gonna say about me and Laura and Kate. But I thought to myself, you know, if I can withstand your corrosive attacks, - your particular brand of analytical castration - That sounds horrible. Why put yourself through that? So that I can trust myself, I suppose. Trust yourself? With what? You know, you said that you were writing a novel. You know, I found that kind of amusing, to tell you the truth, because a novel is about complexity. It's about contradictions, foibles, human folly. Not absolutes. For you, complexity is a problem, some kind of pathology that needs to be treated. And you know what I find fucking offensive, Gina? That you think I'm blind to a situation as obvious as erotic transference. Let me just tell you that I treat Laura with the same integrity, the same concern, the same rigour as I treat all my patients. I happen to like my patients. That's the difference between you and me. I worry about them. I identify with them. I put myself out for them. You analyse them. I analyse, too, but I empathise. Let me ask you something. I'm just curious about this. Do you miss having patients? - Why? - I was never really 100% convinced, to be honest, that you actually like this process, the sitting down with a patient. That's because, in your opinion, I have no empathy and so how could I get any satisfaction from it? I'm not saying you don't get satisfaction, in the way that a sail-maker or or or a chemist gets when they practise their craft. But that thing that I'm talking about between a doctor and a patient, that connection, that buzz See, I can't help but connect with the person. That's who I am as a therapist. That's my That's my reward. A while ago, before, erm, before I started coming here . . there was there was a session that Laura Laura cried. She'd never actually done that before and, erm That's a kind of a victory, right, a kind of milestone for a therapist when you get the patient to that point where they where they cry? It was different with her. There was something so so moving about seeing her just break down like that. In that moment, I swear, I could've said, \"Fuck it all. \"I just want to be with her. \" But I didn't. I came to you instead. I came specially to you. I chose you because I thought to myself, \"If Gina can't convince me to stay away, then how am I gonna convince myself?\" It's really tough when I'm alone with her, you know? And she's asking me, \"Please, just be honest. Please, tell me how you feel. \" And I can't. I guess the reason I'm here is because . . I really wanna look at this. I want to examine it. I wanna be absolutely clear about this . . that I'm not That you're not what? Paul, you need to say it. You need to finish the thought. That what I want isn't, in some way, immoral or unethical. And that it's not abuse An abuse of my power as a doctor with a patient. I'm not pushing you out. I'm not running away, no matter what you tell me. At the institute Maybe that was hubris on my part. I don't know, it might have been. But I won't do that now. I won't reject you. That doesn't mean I'll let you do something that you'll regret the rest of your life, not without fighting you every step. If it's safety you need, this is it. We've already crossed lines of conduct in this room. I'm saying that because I want you to know how far I'm willing to go. Whatever you tell me, I'm here for you. I won't abandon you, no matter what. I'm here. I love her. I love Laura. Every word out of her mouth, every move she makes, I just I love talking to her, you know? Just listening to her. I know it's a joke, cliché. 50-year-old married man in love with a 30-year-old. But I want to be with her and I don't care what it means. And I don't care what it costs. I don't care. I love her."

Besides, I don't want us to both go in there hand in hand, all lovey-dovey, like the movies, \"Guess what, Daddy!\" So it's not exactly that it didn't work out, you've just you've avoided telling him. He hasn't been feeling well lately. He's had all these tests done. Of course I take him. He doesn't know what questions to ask, and he thinks as I am a doctor, they'll be more straight up with me. And to be honest, it'd be much nicer to be in the dark, not know the truth. It could be positive, encouraging, optimistic. He has an MRI today. Maybe the news of you and Andrew would come as a welcome distraction to him. Make him happy. Yeah? Yes."

I hear you, Paul. You want to kick me out of therapy. No, I don't want to kick you out. Absolutely not. I do think that we should allow the possibility into the room. The possibility of us winding down our therapy. Believe me, you let it in. How long have you been thinking about this? Have you been thinking about getting rid of me for a long time? It looks to me like you've been waiting for this to happen, hoping this would happen. My being late today is the perfect excuse to get rid of me. First of all, I'm not getting rid of you, Laura. I'm just asking you to consider whether this therapy is really helping. Oh, so now you're trying to soften the blow. Thank you, don't bother. Secondly, I think that you tossed me out a long time ago. You don't want me to treat you as a psychologist. You want me to treat you as somebody who's in love with you. And in my opinion, that is ruining any chance of this therapy being truly productive. Let's face it. I have not been your therapist for a very long time, Laura. I'm the one who says no to you. I'm the one who humiliates you. I've been humiliating you for the last year by not responding to you. My honest opinion is that it is really difficult to continue therapy this way, from such an emotionally charged place. Therapy should not be a source of constant humiliation for you. You really deserve more. What, you're not a good enough therapist all of a sudden? Am I the first patient to be in love with you, Paul? You've been a therapist for 20 years. Don't you know what to do in these cases? For Christ sakes, just deal with it. Maybe you can't treat me because you're in love with me too. I I can't treat you, Laura, because the boundaries have been breached too often. You've breached them by telling me that you no longer want to be my patient. So fucking what?

I There are sessions when I can barely restrain myself from having just from an outburst. I want to just lock the door some days and wish everybody would just go away. I have this I have this couple who have been coming for marriage counselling. They have one child but they have been trying for five years to have another baby. So, she gets pregnant, and now she wants to have an abortion. I think what she really wants is to get rid of the husband, if you ask me. But anyway, this this guy really got on my nerves yesterday. He cornered me, he badgered me, until I made a decision. \"Should we have an abortion, should we not?\" I finally said, \"Yes, good, have an abortion. \" Soon as I said it, I regretted it, because I knew that I'd spoken in anger. But I couldn't help it - this guy, he just he said some really nasty things to me. He He called me a murderer. I knew he was right, the second it came out of my mouth. I was sitting there, telling him to kill his baby. But still, I was I know I'm not making much sense, but Anyway And there's this girl who I've been working with for a year. There's an issue of erotic transference and this came out and now everything is all about this issue and I'm thinking to myself, \"What \" You know, if patients could see what I think about them, if they could really see inside my head, they'd head for the hills, they'd run for cover. What about new patients? Are you taking on new patients? Yes, I am. I think I take them on to prove to myself that everything is OK. I've taken on this this guy, he's a bomber pilot. Cocky arrogant kind of a guy. Macho, you know. Flew a mission over Iraq. Dropped a bomb on a school where 16 children were killed. So, he comes back, he goes on leave, and then he runs for 22 miles without stopping and brings a heart attack onto himself. So, I'm trying to get this guy to see that maybe there's a connection between these two events, but pfft. Anyway, all the time I listen, you know, as if it's it's nothing. But inside, I'm just I just find it so so disgusting. And there's a girl who goes to Rosie's school, who You you're treating a friend of your daughter's?

You've woken up. You're you're full of life. If that's the way you feel, maybe we shouldn't meet. Yeah. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea after all.

It can explode your lungs from the sudden changes in pressure.

I'm a certified diver. I know what the bends are. Sorry. No, seriously, I dove a lot before I met Andrew. He hates it and he's claustrophobic. It's nice to find we have something in common, you and me, isn't it? Where are you now, Laura? I just had a scary thought. I just, um I know it's silly but beforehand when you said your your lungs could explode, it was just the thought that something might happen to you. Yet you're the one who ascended so fast. You know what, Paul? I don't want a depressing session. I want a happy session. I came with good news, so show a little support. OK. OK, yesterday, um, I was at Natalie's, you know, Andrew's ex, and Gary, the husband. The ones who had a baby a few months ago. They keep inviting us over and I keep avoiding them but yesterday they invited us for brunch Anyway, Gary makes dim sum. He has those bamboo steamers and everything. So I said to Andrew, \"OK, let's go. \" He's been so sweet all week, I thought it was the least I could do. So his agreeing to postpone the ultimatum, that disarmed you? All right. Go ahead. They have a baby. These huge eyes. The baby is all eyes, so beautiful. And the way he breast-feeds, all morning he was attached to Natalie's nipple, this huge dark nipple - I've never seen anything like it. At one point she took her boob out of the baby's mouth and squeezed it and some milk squirted out. And Andrew has this admiring smile on his face, you know, like he was looking at some masterpiece in a museum, like the Madonna. What do you think he saw?

OK So anyway, I go to the kitchen to help out with something and when I come back Andrew and Gary are engrossed in this deep conversation about - you won't believe this - upholsterers. There's this upholsterer who redid their living room and Andrew's taking the guy's number. I'm like, \"What are you doing?\" He said, \"You and I discussed recovering those armchairs your dad gave you. \" I'm telling you, we never discussed this and all of a sudden Andrew's reupholstering armchairs? I mean, we're talking metrosexual. It doesn't sound like the Andrew you've been talking about. Exactly! I mean, this was beyond metrosexual. Do you ever watch, uh, the Animal Planet? Yeah, well, it was about this type of bird. I can't remember the name of it, but anyway, the male bird builds a nest for the female. You know, these amazingly intricate structures. They're incredible. Anyway, the female goes from nest to nest, you know, checking out all her various mating options, trying to make up her mind, while the male bird is desperately flapping about, trying to attract the female with his architecture.

And he says, \"Yes, the movies?\" And I said, \"Yes, home. I'll marry you. \"Yes. \" I mean, fuck it. \"Fuck, I'll marry you, yes. \" Mm. So where do you think this, um \"Fuck it, yes,\" came from? I mean, everything that you've been saying to Andrew, everything you've been doing for the past few weeks has been one big no. I mean, what, you think Andrew took me there as some sort of object lesson? To show me how good it could be for us? Cos I don't think so. Andrew's a pretty mediocre psychologist. Would you listen to me? I'm already bad-mouthing my future husband. You didn't answer my question, Laura. Where did this yes come from? You really don't understand why I said yes to him? It was because you said no to me. Because Because I said no to you? The whole situation is just one big fucking no. I'm not blaming you or accusing you, I'm just Did you expect a different reaction? In your fantasy how would I respond to you saying that you are, let's say, \"in love with me\"? First of all, take the quotation marks off the \"in love with me\". It's insulting.

And the parents are waiting to see if their children are going to live all because of what I did. But what can I tell you? To me, they looked like 200 people standing in line at the pharmacy. Did you feel any connection with them? Did you feel in any way responsible for what they'd suffered? No, no. All I cared about was whether they cheated me or not - I mean, the system. The people in the madrasah, it wasn't any different to seeing it on TV. The only thing on my mind was whether the system knew that the buildings near the target, the one that was supposed to get my bomb, if they knew these buildings were full of children or not, as they claim. Nothing else mattered. So it was important for you to know that you had done the right thing? Like you said last week, if you hit the target you sleep well. Yes.

If I had known you'd called her, I never would've gone shopping. And then she wonders why I run off to the gym to be with her. I mean, to be without her, to get the hell away from her. For my last birthday she gave me a bra. A bra for my birthday? It's like getting coal. It's worse than getting coal. At least you can burn coal.

I really didn't intend that. So, have you taken your SATs yet? Not yet. I have a feeling that you're going to do really well. I expect to. So, your mother bought you these shoes, you hate them and you still wore them. Why? I'm at a total loss. But, hey, why don't you call up my mother and say, \"Hi, Sophie's mom, \"Sophie wore those Barbie shoes that you bought her, \"went to a bar, screwed half the US Olympic gymnastic team \"and now she's gonna kill herself\"? Why'd you do it anyway? Why'd you call her? Because I was worried about you. Suddenly everyone's so worried about me. Did you call Cy, too? He's turned into my grandmother. He won't let me train. He's making me do classes with the ten-year-olds. It's ridiculous. Oh, now I remember what I wanted to tell you. The most amazing thing happened at the gym the other day. Even though I haven't been training, I've been absorbing stuff just by watching. Because I have this chronic problem with my toes going off the edge of the beam when I land a hard element. It's because I'm naturally knock-kneed. My knees, they face inwards. So, in order to get them facing straight my feet have to point out, which is good for ballet but bad for gymnastics. Just a toe in the wrong position can lose you the event. I'm talking about medals here. So, anyway, I'm on the beam, right? And I've been training at night time, even though my body doesn't want to yet. It was like when I was little and I used to starve myself and there would be this period, usually in the morning, where I was really, really hungry. You know, so hungry that I thought that my stomach might just start eating the rest of me. And then it would go away, suddenly, like turning off a light switch. And I felt like I was floating on clouds. It was the same with the pain this time. I pushed through it until it just let up, all of a sudden. And then I felt like I didn't have a body at all, like I was just a pair of somersaulting eyes. So yesterday I marched into the gym and I got up on the beam. Everyone was in shock and I felt this silence all around me."

        "text": "I couldn't give a shit about it either. But that's all everyone wanted to know about - my father, my wife. Everyone wanted to hear about the goddamn tunnel. Just such bullshit. Do you feel that maybe you disappointed people by not having that experience? That maybe in some way you failed to deliver the goods? Nobody really knows what was going through my mind during those last few moments. As soon as there was no more tunnel, no one was interested. And what was going through your mind? Oh, I knew what was happening, you can tell. And you're afraid it's the end. In all that time until I lost consciousness All that time I don't know, it was maybe seconds, maybe half a minute. All that time I kept trying to figure out if I had a hard-on. I don't know how I remembered, it was something my grandmother told me, when I was in high school, and she said when Grandpa died, she found him lying naked in the bathtub with a huge erection. Now, he's he was 92 years old. She hadn't seen an erection like that in 20 years. She liked it. She said that was God's final gift to a man. A dead man's boner. They call it angel lust. Anyway, I'm lying there thinking about that story. I know what's happening and I said to myself, \"God Almighty, just don't let me have an erection now, not a hard-on. \" Because if you had an erection, it would mean That would mean that I was dead. And your friend Daniel was with you throughout this? Yeah, resuscitation, CPR Daniel's a doctor. I forgot to say that. Oh. For a minute I thought you were going to say something else, that perhaps your fear of an erection was associated with the presence of your friend, Daniel. Excuse me? You're exaggerating. I explained something simple, a dead man's erection - what's that got to do with Daniel? Well, maybe I didn't make myself clear earlier on when I was talking about the customer always being wrong. What I meant was that sometimes the patient hides things from his therapist, from himself. And so part of our job is to uncover the things that we hide. So, my secret is I'm afraid of homosexuals? No, not necessarily. But I just wanted to clarify that. Yeah, that's neither here nor there. I want to get to my point. I didn't have the erection, so relax. But I remember very vividly that moment just before passing out, before losing consciousness. Losing consciousness, that's a funny expression. Why do you think that's a funny expression? Losing consciousness - it's an expression my father would use. Everything in terms of profits and loss. Fits him like a glove. So something about how you describe your last moments is equated with your father's seeing things in terms of profit and loss? OK, OK, with all due respect, I think we've come to this way too early. The father-son relationship stuff shouldn't come up so soon."

The tunnel that wasn't there? No, unfortunately not. So tell me what you remember about this 48 hours. Mostly I remember, um a terrible fatigue. I guess that's why they call it \"dead tired\". It's physical, but mainly mental exhaustion. And I remember very clearly the relief I felt when I succeeded in coming back over into the world. You say that you succeeded in coming back to this world. Did Did you feel it was under your control? - What are you trying to get at? - I'm not trying to get at anything. But what you're describing is a strong will to live. During this experience, there was a decision to go on living. Yeah, I guess you're right. Despite having made this effort to live everybody's disappointed. It's not every day people meet someone who's come back from the dead. It's a one-in-a-million thing. And if you don't supply the goods, then Listen, I have never spent a day in my life in a hospital. You get it? Never. So, perhaps your anger isn't directed at those people interested in the tunnel. Perhaps you're angry at yourself, Alex. How your body betrayed you. This is a systems failure that was not supposed to happen to somebody like you. Hmh. I have a brother, who's not bright, he's a real-estate agent. Anyway, he's a great athlete. And he once proved to me, and he does his research, believe me that all the great quarterbacks in the history of football were also the best looking.

These two friends are condemned to death but the king, he liked them and he didn't want to kill them. So, instead, he tied a thin rope across this abyss. And he told them both to walk over the rope. Whoever made it to the other side would be allowed to live. So the first one walked over the rope and he makes it safely to the other side. And after he made it, his friend yells out to him, \"How did you do it?\" And the other guy answered, \"I have no idea. \"All I know is that whenever my weight pulled me to one side, \"I leaned to the other. \" Ain't exactly Lord Of The Rings. True. So does it mean that you have to maintain balance in your life? I think what it means is there are no simple ways of jumping over an abyss. Or ways that work for everyone. I think what you're looking for, Alex, is a million-dollar magic trick and I don't have that. I truly believe there is no simple way to jump across an abyss. Instead, we have to work in small, internal steps. The question is whether you want us, you and I, to engage in that process."

Ignore your feelings completely, rely on your instruments. That's what the air controller tells you, that's what you're telling me. Eyes on your instruments. So you want me to put myself into your hands, you want to navigate me. Rely on you. On the one hand, you're right. But keeping my eyes on my instruments is what got me here. What do you mean?

Don't assume that everybody who sees me is miserable. Look, when I came to pick her up from here yesterday, she was like a psychopath. One minute she's hugging me, so over the top, like we're in some kind of movie. The next minute, \"Take me home. I'm too tired to do anything today. \" I mean, what the fuck? She turned as cold as ice. She was two different people. What goes through her head? Listen to what you're saying. You're belittling her again. You don't think she belittles me? You don't think I know that she's completely hung up on someone else? Check this out. Saturday. After we had sex, she straddles my leg. She starts rubbing up against me as if I'm not even there. It's so obvious she's fantasising about somebody else. And then, she starts crying. Tears and everything. She's just crying. And I ask her, \"Laura, what's up? \"Everything OK?\" She didn't even look at me. She didn't even answer me. Like I'm just her dildo. I got so Don't tell me I belittle her, OK?

        "text": "Previously on In Treatment. I hear you, Paul, you wanna kick me out of therapy, I get it. No, I don't want to kick you out, absolutely not. I think that you tossed me out a long time ago. You don't want me to treat you as a psychologist. You want me to treat you as somebody who's in love with you. Let's face it, I have not been your therapist for a very long time, Laura. Maybe you can't treat me because you're in love with me, too. Where you headed? You need a ride? Laura. Let's do it. Paul? Paul? Sorry. Um, you said that it, uh that it happened in the kitchen. No, it started in the kitchen. Are you listening to me? Yes. Yes, I am. I said I wanted to do it right there on the counter. So when he picked me up, I thought, \"OK,\" but no, he took me into the bedroom and he put me down ever so gently like I was, I don't know, a porcelain vase or something. Everything was very cautious, hesitant, like he didn't know what to do. Maybe he didn't know what to do with someone who wasn't his wife. Yeah, he kept telling me he hasn't done it with anyone but his wife for ten years and hardly then. It was very sweet, actually. He imitated me. He did everything I did. I took off his shirt, he took off my shirt. I told him he has a fantastic body because he does, and he goes, \"So do you. \" At one point he strokes my hair and he asks me what kind of shampoo I use. Can you believe this? We're lying face to face, petting each other like high school kids. Anyway, I get sick of it, so I say to myself, \"Maybe he's waiting for a signal. \"Maybe he wants me to lead. \"Maybe if I start doing something, things will finally get moving. \" So, I went down on him. Everything was so proper. I didn't want proper, I just wanted him to fuck without all the bullshit about my shampoo and my beautiful breasts and my excellent taste in curtains. So, did that move things along? - What, the blowjob? - Mm-hm. Of course. Do you know what? He doesn't like sex. You know what I mean? He doesn't really like it. It's like he's carrying out an assignment, a mission, like a pilot. What do you mean, like a, like a pilot? You know those guys that mark tally points on their fighter jet to keep track of how many planes they shot down? It was like that, like he was keeping score. I mean, he didn't even touch me while he was going at it. He was just leaning on his elbows as if he didn't want any connection between us, except where necessary. I kept trying to bring my face closer to his to kiss him, and he just kept pulling his face away as if he couldn't stand me. And that was it. It was very fast, two minutes, more or less, and then he came. And then he went straight to the bathroom and I just lay there in shock. I mean, he didn't even ask me how it was, if I was OK or not. Nothing. Anyway, I made myself come. While he was in the bathroom? - No, when he got back. I had to. I mean, I hate to be left high and dry. He was just lying on his back, conducting dialogue with the ceiling, or maybe with his wife or maybe with you, and he looked so fucking sexy, so I climbed on top of his leg. Thought he'd get the hint and he'd start something, but nothing. So I just kept going, riding his thigh. Felt good. Then I was overwhelmed with this sadness for him. Broke my heart, this guy. He's fragile, really, that's what he is. I don't think he could tell what I was thinking. I was completely in my own head and I was thinking to myself, \"Shit, this is gonna be the saddest orgasm of my life. \" Here I am, riding this hot, sad guy's thigh. I was expecting something pitiful and measly, right? But, no. A volcano is a cliché but that's what it was. It was like ten orgasms exploding at once. It's hard to describe. But I screamed. I did, I screamed and I think I scared him. You would've been really proud of me."

He isn't your only patient. He doesn't belong to you. He's a great guy. OK, a little fucked up, a little insecure in bed maybe, but he's got potential. I think I'm gonna have a terrific affair with him. Still, it's no coincidence that you went to bed with him and I don't think it's a coincidence that you began your affair shortly after we talked about your quitting therapy. Are you saying that I did this to get back at you? Remember the guy you told me about, the guy you met at the bar, that you went to the rest room with? You said that you felt you were with me. It's not the same thing, Paul. Are you sure it isn't? It was during that session, Laura, that you decided to tell me that you were in love with me. And that's how you chose to tell me how you felt about me, by having sex with another man. One thing that I put out there, without hinting or manipulation, is that I've wanted you. So I don't need to fuck another man just to get my message across. What made you so sad about Alex? His loneliness, he's a sad guy."

I think it seems more like, \"Look what you missed out on, Paul, you coward, you idiot. \" Mm. I'm tired. I'm really so tired. So, uh, after Alex left, I couldn't fall asleep.

Every Friday afternoon, after I finished playing with my friends, I used to come home. That smell was intoxicating. It was like a trail of scent paving my way home. Like a cartoon character. Then my mother got sick. The cancer was only stage one at that point, when they found it. When she started chemo, she stopped baking. You know, she was tired, she had no energy. That was the first sign, the first sign that something really big was about to happen. When she was really sick, I used to find myself roaming the halls of the apartment building, climbing up and down the stairs, searching for that smell of cheesecake. Shit, how corny is that? And once I remember a woman coming out of her apartment and she, uh Thank you. . . and she saw me standing out there, she didn't know who I was. She must've been new to the building. And she was yelling at me, \"Go away, go on, go home. \"What are you doing standing out here?\" Why do you think you had that particular memory the other night? I don't know. I searched through my whole apartment looking for a recipe, but Not that that would've done any good. My fridge is completely empty. I thought about going out to get a piece but it was 3am, so I just gave up and went to sleep. Only then the phone rang and it was Alex. He called to thank me and tell me he had an amazing time with me and that he wants to see me again. Go figure, huh? He's supposed to pick me up from here soon."

So that we could be together, is that what you mean? We've been together for a year, Paul. A year. There's more intimacy between us than most couples in the world, isn't that right? - I don't deny a certain intimacy can develop - \"A certain intimacy. \" Cut the crap, Paul. Is there intimacy here or not? Yes. There is. And now you're willing to throw that all away? - And why, because y-you're scared? - Laura I know that, as a therapist, you tell yourself it's part of therapy to find out why I'm in love with you and how that's linked to my past but isn't that always the way it works, Paul? Doesn't our past always determine who we fall in love with? So what if you can trace it back to the withholding mother, the narcissistic father, the parent who's missing? Does that make our love any less real? - But circumstances can be less than ideal - I know that. I know you can delude yourself into thi Only I am not deluded. Not about you, not about how I feel about you, why I feel it, there's always gonna be an explanation, but that I feel it is irrefutable. I don't know how to convince you any more.

Maybe you should see someone. Yeah. I've been thinking about that.

My mother, she was in pretty bad shape and, um I took care of her, but, uh I couldn't I couldn't save her from herself, you know? I guess I hated myself for that. Was she sick? She was in a difficult emotional state. I thought that I could pull her out of it. I I used to cook her all these elaborate meals but she wouldn't eat them. Couldn't understand why.
