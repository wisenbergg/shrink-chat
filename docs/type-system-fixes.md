# Type System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. Added missing `MessageTurn` type in `types.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export interface MessageTurn {
     role: "user" | "assistant";
     content: string;
   }
   ```

   This fixed errors in the `fallbacks.ts` file which was importing this type but it wasn't defined.

2. Fixed type issues in `memory-test/page.tsx`:

   - Added proper interface for search results with optional similarity_score
   - Created a comprehensive DebugInfo interface to define the shape of the debug state
   - Added null/undefined handling for API responses

3. Fixed minor React type issues with ReactNode compatibility

## Impact

These fixes ensure type safety throughout the application and prevent runtime errors that would occur when handling data from the memory system. The changes improve the reliability of:

- The fallback system for handling repetitive or crisis messages
- The memory test page which demonstrates memory storage and retrieval
- The short-term memory cache using LRU

## Notes for Future Development

When working with the memory system:

1. Always handle null/undefined cases for database responses
2. Use proper typing for the MemoryEntry objects and any extensions
3. When updating types, ensure all files that use them are also updated

Any extensions to the memory system should follow these type patterns to maintain consistency.
