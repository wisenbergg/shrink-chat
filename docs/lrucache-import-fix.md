# LRUCache Import Fix

## Issue

The application was breaking with the following error:

```
Attempted import error: 'lru-cache' does not contain a default export (imported as 'LRUCache').
TypeError: lru_cache__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.default is not a constructor
```

## Cause

The error occurred because we were using an incorrect import pattern for the LRUCache library. The library exports a named export, not a default export.

Additionally, the `shortTermMemory.ts` file had multiple issues:

1. Duplicate code sections that created conflicting declarations
2. Inconsistent import statements (both named and default imports were present)
3. Garbled comments and broken file structure (e.g., "// Short-term memo// Short-term memory cache")
4. Multiple conflicting LRUCache initializations

## Solution

The import statement in `shortTermMemory.ts` has been fixed to use the correct named import:

```typescript
// Incorrect (was causing the error):
import LRUCache from "lru-cache";

// Correct (fixed version):
import { LRUCache } from "lru-cache";
```

Additionally, we've confirmed that the LRUCache constructor works correctly with the type parameters:

```typescript
const shortTermMemoryCache = new LRUCache<string, ShortTermMemory>({
  max: 1000,
  ttl: 1000 * 60 * 30,
});
```

## Current State

- The application now starts and runs correctly
- The short-term memory functionality is working as intended
- The test script uses the same import pattern and runs successfully

## Note for Future Development

When using external libraries, always check the correct import pattern for the specific version of the library. The lru-cache v11.x.x uses named exports, not default exports.

## Related Fixes

Additional issues were identified and fixed that were related to type safety:

1. Added missing `MessageTurn` type in `types.ts`
2. Fixed type issues in `memory-test/page.tsx` with proper interfaces
3. Added null/undefined handling for memory results

See `/docs/type-system-fixes.md` for more details on these changes.
