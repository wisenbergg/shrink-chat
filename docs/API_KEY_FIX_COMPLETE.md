# API Key Fix Summary

## Original Issues

1. OpenAI API key configuration was inconsistent across different modules
2. System environment variable with an invalid placeholder value was taking precedence over the correct key in .env.local
3. Some files were directly using `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY` without proper validation
4. Missing instance of openai client in predictSignal.ts

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. API Key Loader Module

Created `/src/lib/apiKeyLoader.ts` to reliably load the correct API key with the following features:

- Cache mechanism for performance
- Validation of API key format
- Fallback mechanism to read from .env.local file directly
- Error handling for missing keys

### 2. Fixed Direct API Calls

- Updated `src/lib/predictSignal.ts` to properly instantiate the OpenAI client
- Updated core modules to use the apiKeyLoader instead of direct environment access
- Fixed naming conventions (emotional_tone vs emotionalTone)

### 3. Debug and Cleanup

- Created utilities for diagnosing API key issues (check-openai-key.mjs)
- Created scripts for testing API access (test-openai-key.mjs)
- Created reset-env.sh to resolve environment variable conflicts
- Created cleanup.sh to remove temporary debug files
- Fixed file corruption issues in several route.ts files

### 4. Documentation

- Added comprehensive README.md with project information and troubleshooting steps
- Created dedicated API_KEY_FIX.md with detailed explanation for future reference

## Further Recommendations

1. Use a more robust environment variable management system
2. Implement runtime environment validation on application startup
3. Add unit tests specifically for API key loading and validation
4. Consider adding a system-wide configuration validation at build/deploy time

The application should now correctly handle the OpenAI API key in all contexts, preserving the correct key from .env.local even when conflicting system environment variables exist.
