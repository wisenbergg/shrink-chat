# Short-Term Memory Enhancement

## Problem

Even with the vector database fix, the chat application still had an issue with immediate recall. Specifically, when a user introduces themselves and then immediately asks if the AI remembers their name, the AI would fail to recall it. This happens because:

1. Vector embedding generation and processing is asynchronous
2. Database operations take time to complete
3. There's a short delay between storing information and being able to retrieve it

This created an unnatural conversation flow where the AI would appear to "forget" something the user just mentioned.

## Solution: Short-Term Memory System

We've implemented a dual-memory architecture by adding a short-term memory system that works alongside the vector database:

1. **Short-term memory**: In-memory LRU cache for immediate recall
2. **Long-term memory**: Vector database for semantic search over conversation history

## Implementation Details

### Short-Term Memory Module (`src/lib/shortTermMemory.ts`)

The short-term memory module uses an LRU cache to provide immediate access to recent information:

```typescript
// Key functions in shortTermMemory.ts
storeInShortTermMemory(threadId, key, value);
getFromShortTermMemory(threadId, key);
extractAndStoreUserName(threadId, message);
isAskingForName(query);
storeConversationMessage(threadId, role, content);
getRecentConversation(threadId);
handleNameQuery(threadId, query);
```

### Integration in Chat Component (`ShrinkChat.tsx`)

The chat handling logic was updated to:

1. Store messages in both memory systems
2. Check if the user is asking about their name
3. If so, check short-term memory first
4. Respond immediately if the name is found there
5. Otherwise proceed with vector memory lookup

```typescript
// Check if user is asking about their name
const { isNameQuery, name } = handleNameQuery(threadId, prompt);

if (isNameQuery && name) {
  // If the user is asking about their name and we have it in short-term memory,
  // respond immediately without calling the API
  setTimeout(() => {
    const response = `Your name is ${name}.`;
    setMessages((prev) => [...prev, { sender: "engine", text: response }]);

    // Also store the assistant's response in short-term memory
    storeConversationMessage(threadId, "assistant", response);

    if (!reminderSent) scheduleSilenceHandler();
    setIsTyping(false);
    setIsLoading(false);
  }, 1000);
  return;
}
```

### Pattern Recognition

The system can detect name introduction patterns:

- "My name is [Name]"
- "I am [Name]"
- "I'm [Name]"
- "Call me [Name]"
- "Name's [Name]"

And name-related queries:

- "What is my name?"
- "Do you remember my name?"
- "What did you call me?"
- "Do you know who I am?"

## Testing

We created a standalone test script (`test-short-term-memory-standalone.mjs`) that verifies:

- Proper storage and retrieval
- Name extraction from messages
- Query pattern detection
- Immediate name recall after introduction

All tests pass, confirming that the short-term memory system correctly handles the edge case of immediate name recall.

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: No delays when recalling recently mentioned information
2. **More Natural Conversations**: The AI appears to pay attention to what the user just said
3. **Reduced Database Load**: Fewer unnecessary database operations for simple recall tasks
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to vector search for more complex queries or older information

This solution addresses the immediate memory recall issue while maintaining the benefits of the long-term vector-based memory system.
